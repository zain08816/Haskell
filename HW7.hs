-- CS 314, Fall 2020, Homework 7
-- Due 10:00 PM, November 23
-- Read the directions below, add your answers to this file, and submit it via Sakai.
-- Updated 2020-11-16: clarification of "contains"
-- Updated 2020-11-17: in language 3, added that A cannot be followed by C
--                     added some examples
-- Updated 2020-11-18: BCA is part of language 3

-- Each of the questions below describe a regular language over the alphabet symbols,
-- given below. Note that we use a custom Symbol type, rather than Char.

data Symbol = A | B | C | D deriving (Show, Eq)
symbols = [A,B,C,D]

-- For each question:
--
-- 1. Write a comment giving a regular expression for the language, written using the
--    notation from class. (You may write e for epsilon.)
--
-- 2. Write the same regular expression as a value of type RE Symbol. You must write the
--    value using only the constructors for RE and Symbol, or using functions you write
--    that are included in this file. Do not import Parser.hs.
--
-- 3. Define a DFA for the language. You may find it helpful to draw graphs on paper,
--    but you do not need to hand them in.
--
-- 4. Define your DFA as a value of type DFA state Symbol, for some convenient type state.
--    (Int is probably the most convenient type, but you are free to use any instance of
--    Eq.) You must give symbols as the alphabet.
--
-- You will be graded on the correctness of your RE and DFA values, which will be
-- determined by testing on randomly generated inputs. Your file should be runnable
-- Haskell code; you will lose points if your file cannot be loaded in GHCi.
--
-- You are encouraged, but not required, to justify why your RE and DFA describe the
-- specified language. In the event that your RE or DFA is incorrect, you may receive
-- partial credit based on the quality of your explanation.
--
-- Please make use of the provided dfaCheck function to make sure your DFA defines a
-- transition for every combination of symbol and state, and does not make a transition
-- to an unlisted state.

-- dfaCheck tries every combination of symbol and state for a DFA, and checks whether the
-- resulting state is listed.

-- Write a function reps, such that reps m n r is a regular expression that matches
-- strings that can be broken into at least m and not more than n substrings, each of
-- which matches r. That is, reps represents repetition with specified minimum and
-- maximum bounds.
--
-- Your function should handle negative integers as though they were 0. It should return
-- RZero if n < m.
